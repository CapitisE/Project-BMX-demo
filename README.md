This is little task to test your git knowledge

Hi guys, We will go through a typical git-github workflow for Devs and tech-inclined individuals.

## Task:
Create a directory and add a file to the directory. The directory and file should be in the following format `your_name` and `your_name.txt`

> Note that `.txt` indicates that it is a text file. For uniformity, please use that.

### Steps:
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the forked repository
3. Then create a directory and add `your_name.txt` file
4. Add,commmit,and push to this repo
5. Open a new pull request.
6. Wait for merging confirmation


> Note use proper `git commit` practices

Arigato.
